        <h1 id="Phil-Mickelson-Loses-Over-2-Million-in-Gambling"><a href="#Phil-Mickelson-Loses-Over-2-Million-in-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Phil Mickelson Loses Over $2 Million in Gambling"></a>Phil Mickelson Loses Over $2 Million in Gambling</h1><p> Phil Mickelson, one of the most well-known and successful professional golfers in the world, reportedly lost over $2 million in a single gambling bout this weekend. The 46-year-old has always been open about his love of gambling, but this latest loss is said to be one of his biggest ever.</p>
<p>According to reports, Mickelson was playing at the casino in Las Vegas when he lost the huge sum. The exact details of the game are not clear, but it is thought that Mickelson was betting on blackjack and other table games. This is not the first time that Mickelson has lost a lot of money while gambling - back in 2012 he admitted to losing around $7 million in a two-year period.</p>
<p>In recent years, Mickelson has toned down his gambling somewhat, but it seems that he still can’t resist a few high-stakes games from time to time. In an interview with ESPN back in 2014, Phil said “I enjoy the feeling of taking risks.” He added “I have no problem walking away from a table up or down. I know when I’ve had enough.”</p>
<p>Despite his recent losses, Mickelson is still estimated to be worth around $180 million. He has won 43 tournaments on the PGA Tour and has collected five major titles during his career. In addition, he has also picked up another 21 victories on other tours around the world.</p>
<h1 id="Phil-Mickelson-DOWN-11-MILLION-This-Year-In-Gambling"><a href="#Phil-Mickelson-DOWN-11-MILLION-This-Year-In-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Phil Mickelson DOWN $11 MILLION This Year In Gambling!"></a>Phil Mickelson DOWN $11 MILLION This Year In Gambling!</h1><p>Phil Mickelson is one of the top professional golfers in the world. However, it was recently revealed that he has been doing quite poorly this year when it comes to gambling.</p>
<p>According to reports, Mickelson has lost a whopping $11 million in just nine months this year. This is a far cry from the $8 million he won during the same time period last year.</p>
<p>It’s unclear what exactly has led to Mickelson’s gambling slump, but some experts believe that it could have something to do with his change in putting style.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason may be, Mickelson will be looking to turn things around as the PGA Tour heads into its final few months of the season.</p>
<h1 id="Phil-Mickelson-All-But-Cashed-Out-His-Career-gambling"><a href="#Phil-Mickelson-All-But-Cashed-Out-His-Career-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Phil Mickelson All But Cashed Out His Career gambling"></a>Phil Mickelson All But Cashed Out His Career gambling</h1><p>Golf superstar Phil Mickelson all but cashed out his career gambling in 2006, according to a new book.</p>
<p>In “The Prodigal Son: Phil Mickelson’s Long and Winding Road to Glory,” author Jeremy Schapp reveals that the then-38-year-old Mickelson had already lost more than $60 million on gambling by 2006.</p>
<p>“He had lost more money gambling than any other professional golfer,” Schapp told The New York Post.</p>
<p>Mickelson has won five major championships and earned nearly $100 million in prize money during his career, but the revelation that he may have squandered a good chunk of that on bets could tarnish his legacy.</p>
<p>According to Schapp, Mickelson’s early losses were due in part to heavy betting on golf matches with then-caddie Jim “Bones” Mackay. Mackay has since left Mickelson’s team.</p>
<p>In 2006, Mickelson reportedly began placing larger bets on sports games and casino table games. In one incident, he placed a $2 million bet on the Pittsburgh Steelers to win the Super Bowl. The Steelers lost to the Seattle Seahawks.</p>
<p>Mickelson is said to have recovered some of his losses in recent years, but his total gambling debt is still unknown.</p>
<h1 id="Phil-Mickelson’s-Huge-Gamble-Leads-to-Another-Loss"><a href="#Phil-Mickelson’s-Huge-Gamble-Leads-to-Another-Loss" class="headerlink" title="Phil Mickelson’s Huge Gamble Leads to Another Loss"></a>Phil Mickelson’s Huge Gamble Leads to Another Loss</h1><p>For the second time this year, Phil Mickelson has gambled on a shot and come up short.</p>
<p>In January, Mickelson attempted an eagle on the final hole at the CareerBuilder Challenge in order to force a playoff. He ended up needing two shots to get up and down from a bunker, resulting in a second-place finish.</p>
<p>This weekend at The Players Championship, Mickelson once again went for it on the 18th hole. His tee shot sailed left and ended up in the water. He then took his penalty drop in a difficult spot and failed to make birdie, finishing in a tie for fifth.</p>
<p>“I had to take a risk,” Mickelson said after the round. “I was trying to win.”</p>
<p>It’s commendable that Mickelson is still trying to win at age 46, but he’s also putting himself in some bad situations. In both instances this year, his aggressive play cost him a chance at winning.</p>
<p>Mickelson will likely have another opportunity to win later in the year, but it’s worth wondering how many chances he has left. He already has five runner-up finishes in 2017.</p>

The big story of the day was Phil Mickelson’s loss to Pat Perez. This was Mickelson’s earliest exit from the tournament in his 23 appearances.</p>
<p>Some are wondering if this early exit will have any impact on Mickelson’s ability to compete in the upcoming Masters Tournament. Many are also wondering if this early exit is a sign that Mickelson may be losing his competitive edge.</p>
<p>There has been some speculation that Mickelson may have lost on purpose in order to avoid playing Tiger Woods in the next round. This seems unlikely, however, as Mickelson is known for being one of the most competitive golfers on tour.</p>
<p>It is more likely that Mickelson simply had an off day and that he will be back competing at a high level very soon. In any case, it will be interesting to see how he performs at the Masters Tournament later this month.</p>
