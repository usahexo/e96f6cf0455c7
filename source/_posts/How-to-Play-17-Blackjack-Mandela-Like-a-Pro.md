#  How to Play 17 Blackjack Mandela Like a Pro

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world. In this game, players attempt to beat the dealer by collecting cards that total 21 or less. The game can be played with 1 to 8 decks of cards, and the player’s objective is to obtain a card total as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. If the player “busts” or exceeds 21, he automatically loses the hand.

In blackjack, the Ace is both high and low card, counting as 1 or 11 points, respectively. The other numbered cards count at their face value. So, a hand consisting of an Ace of Spades and a Two of Hearts would total 3 points (Ace=1 point; Two=2 points).

The game begins with all players placing an initial bet. The dealer then deals two cards to each player and two cards to himself (one face up, one down). After that, he distributes another card face up to each player (the second card from the top of the deck). This is called the “flop”. At this point in the game, players have multiple options: receive more cards (hit), stand with their current total (stand), double down on their current total (double down), or split their current hand into two separate hands if they are holding two cards of equal rank (split).

In order to win blackjack, you must first understand when it’s correct to hit and when it’s correct to stand. A general rule-of-thumb is that you should continue hitting until your hand totals 17 or higher. At this point, it becomes better to stand rather than risk going bust. Conversely, if your starting hand is below 17 points, you should continue taking hits until you reach 17 or higher. This will minimize your chances of busting and increase your chances of winning overall.

Similarly, there are times when you should choose to double down on your hand. For example, if you have an Ace and a Ten-value card as your first two cards (also known as a “blackjack”), you should double down since you have a strong chance of winning automatically. Other good times to double down include when your first two cards add up to 11 points or less and when your opponent has fewer than 16 points showing on his first two cards. Remember that doubling down allows you to place an additional bet equal to your original bet which will guarantee at least one more turn with two extra cards being dealt (assuming no dealer blackjack). 

If you find yourself in a situation where you can split your hand into two separate hands, it may be advantageous to do so. For example, if you are initially dealt two 8-point cards, you can split them into two separate hands (one with each 8-point card) and then play each hand independently from thereon out. This increases your chances of winning since you now have two chances instead of one to get closer to 21 points without exceeding it. Keep in mind that splitting also doubles your bet amount so make sure that doing so is worth it given the circumstances at hand. 

Now that we’ve covered some basic strategy for playing blackjack like a pro, let’s take a look at some specific situations that might come up during a typical game session: 

Situation #1: You are dealt an Ace and a 2 as your first two cards - what should you do?



 In this case, it would be wise to hit since having an Ace and 2 together results in only 3 points total - not near enough for victory just yet! By hitting again and hopefully obtaining another low-point card like a 4 or 5 ,your combined point total will be much closer to 21 - putting yourself in better position for winning this particular round of blackjack.<br /><br />Situation #2: You are dealt an Ace and a King as your first two cards - what should you do?



 In this scenario, it would be best not take any more cards since having an Ace and King already totals 14 points - just 2 shy from winning outright! Sometimes it's smarter mathematically simply let what's already been dealt work in ones favor rather than trying too hard betting control the remainder of the hand.<br /><br />Situation #3: After receiving her first four cards ,the player has 15 Points



 In this case ,the player should hit because they have not gone over 21.<br /><br />Situation #4: The Dealer shows an Ace



 If the dealer has shown an ace ,players who have not busted must take another card .This includes players who have 21 because if dealer has blackjack ,the house still wins against all players who haven't busted

When playing 17 blackjack, it’s important to choose your seat carefully. Ideally, you want to be seated as close to the dealer as possible so that you can see what they are doing. This also gives you an opportunity to chat with the dealer and get some helpful insights into their strategy.

#  Win More Games With These Helpful Tips for Playing 17 Blackjack Mandela 

Are you looking for a few helpful tips to increase your chances of winning when playing 17 Blackjack Mandela? If so, you have come to the right place. Here we will share with you some valuable advice that should help improve your game. So, without further ado, let’s get started.

Tip #1: Know Your Odds

The first thing you need to do before sitting down at the blackjack table is familiarize yourself with the odds. This way, you will have a good idea of what to expect and how best to play against the dealer. In general, the house edge is around 1% when playing blackjack, but it can vary depending on the rules of the particular game being played.

Tip #2: Start With Lower Bet Amounts

If this is your first time playing blackjack or if you are not quite comfortable with the game just yet, start off by making smaller bets. This will help minimize your losses in case things don’t go your way and will also allow you to continue playing for longer periods of time. As you gain more experience and become more comfortable with the game, you can then start betting larger amounts.

Tip #3: Stay Away From Hard Hands

When starting out, it is generally a good idea to avoid playing hard hands (hands that contain two cards with a value of 10 or less). This is because your chances of winning are relatively low in these cases and the odds are heavily stacked against you. Instead, focus on soft hands (hands that contain an Ace) as they offer a much better chance of winning.

Tip #4: Split Aces & Eights If Possible

If you are lucky enough to be dealt an Ace and an Eight as your first two cards, consider splitting them up into two separate hands. This move will give you a better chance of winning as opposed to hitting on either hand separately. Just be sure to remember that if you split Aces, you can only receive one additional card per hand; likewise, if you split Eights, then each hand must receive two additional cards.

Tip #5: Use The Blackjack Strategy Chart


If you want to give yourself the best possible chance of winning at blackjack, then make use of a strategy chart. This handy tool lays out all of the possible moves that you can make during a given situation and tells you which ones are most likely to result in a win. So whether you are a beginner or an experienced player, using a strategy chart is always advisable.

Once you understand the rules, it's important to choose a betting strategy. A good strategy to follow is splitting pairs (doubling your bet and splitting your cards into two separate hands) and doubling down (doubling your bet and taking just one more card).
