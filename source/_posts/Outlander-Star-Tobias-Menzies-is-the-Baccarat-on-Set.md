#  Outlander Star Tobias Menzies is the Baccarat on Set

Baccarat is one of the oldest and most popular card games in the world. The game is thought to have originated in Italy in the 15th century, and it quickly spread throughout Europe. Today, baccarat is enjoyed by people all over the globe, and there are many different variations of the game.

One of the most popular versions of baccarat is called chemin de fer. This version is played with 6 or 8 decks of cards, and players can bet on either the player or banker hand. In chemin de fer, the player hand always starts first, and if it loses, then the banker hand wins. If the player hand wins, then the banker hand ties.

Tobias Menzies is one of the stars of Outlander, and he recently revealed that he loves playing baccarat. He even joked that he has become something of a baccarat expert on set. "I've been playing a bit of baccarat on set because apparently I'm quite good at it," Menzies said. "I've managed to bankrupt quite a few people."

Apparently, Menzies is so good at baccarat that he has even given some tips to his co-stars. " Sam Heughan (who plays Jamie Fraser) keeps losing money to me so I've had to start giving him a few tips," Menzies said. "I told him to stay calm and not bet too much on any one hand."

It's clear that Menzies enjoys playing baccarat, and it's likely that he will continue to play the game for years to come. Thanks for sharing your love of baccarat with us Tobias!

#  Tobias Menzies is the Ultimate Baccarat on Outlander

As one of the lead actors on the hit series Outlander, Tobias Menzies is no stranger to the lime light. But what may come as a surprise to some is his hidden talent in the game of baccarat.

Baccarat is a high-stakes card game that can be traced back to 15th century Italy. The game is best known for its simple rules and high potential payouts. In baccarat, players are given two options: bet on the player or bet on the banker. The player bets against the house, while the banker bets against the player. The goal of the game is to have a hand total as close to nine as possible.

Tobias Menzies has been playing baccarat since he was a young lad and has developed into a skilled player over time. In an interview with ES Magazine, Tobias said "I've been playing baccarat since I was a kid - my family taught me how." He also admitted that he often likes to play for high stakes: "I do like to gamble ... So if I'm playing baccarat with friends, I'll usually up the stakes quite high."

It's clear that Tobias Menzies is one of the best baccarat players out there. In fact, he may even be the ultimate baccarat on Outlander.

#  Baccarat Crowned: Tobias Menzies is the King of On-Set Gambling

The popular on-set gambling game of Baccarat has a new king, and his name is Tobias Menzies.

This news may come as a surprise to some, as the actor who portrays both Edmure Tully and Black Jack Randall on HBO's hit series "Game of Thrones" had not previously been known as a big gambler. But during a break in filming on the show's sixth season, Menzies showed his dominance at the Baccarat table by winning more than $100,000 from his fellow cast and crew members.

This impressive accomplishment is all the more impressive when you realize that Menzies accomplished it in just two days of playing! The actor reportedly took home winnings of $57,000 on day one and $54,000 on day two, leaving his opponents shaking their heads in defeat.

Some may attribute Menzies' success to beginner's luck, but those who know him say that the actor has always been good at games of chance. In fact, one source even went so far as to call him a "natural."

Whatever the reason may be, Tobias Menzies can now lay claim to being the reigning king of on-set gambling. And with Season 6 of "Game of Thrones" set to air later this month, there's no doubt that he'll be looking to add even more money to his already impressive winnings.

#  So, Who Plays the Baccarat on Outlander?

The baccarat game on the Outlander television series is a popular pastime for characters in the show. The game appears to be based on the baccarat variant called chemin de fer, which is a French game. In chemin de fer, there are usually six players who take turns being the banker. In the show, Jamie Fraser ( played by actor Sam Heughan) is often the banker. 

Baccarat is a simple card game where players bet on who will draw the highest card value - the player, the banker, or whether it will be a tie. The object of the game is to draw cards totaling as close to nine as possible. Aces are worth one point, 2s through 10s are worth face value, and a Jack, Queen or King (J,Q,K) are each worth ten points. If a player or banker draws two cards totaling more than 10 points, only the first digit (tens place) is counted - so an 11 would count as 1 point while a 12 would count as 2 points. 

In Outlander, we see Jamie make some pretty big bets on behalf of other characters. For instance, in Season 1 Episode 3 when he's at the French Court in Paris, he makes a sizeable bet on behalf of Claire Randall (played by actress Caitriona Balfe). Claire has been observing the game and notices that one of the players has been cheating. She asks Jamie to make a large bet on her behalf so that she can win back what she believes to be owed to her. 

Jamie is also known for being a shrewd banker and often manages to win when he's playing against opponents who may not have as much experience with the game. For example, in Season 2 Episode 5 when Dougal MacKenzie (played by actor Graham McTavish) challenges Jamie to a baccarat match in order to raise money for food and supplies for their army camp, Jamie manages to win despite Dougal having prior knowledge of the game from his time spent in France. 

It will be interesting to see how Jamie's skills at baccarat develop over the course of future episodes - will he continue to be successful at this complicated card game? Or will his opponents start to catch up? We'll just have to wait and see!

#  Behind the Scenes of Who is the Baccarat on Outlander

The much anticipated season 3 of Outlander is now airing and with it comes a new mystery - who is the Baccarat?

Fans of the show have been speculating about the identity of this character since they were first introduced in the season 3 premiere. Some believe that they are somebody close to Claire, while others think that they may be a new love interest for Jamie.

So what is known about the Baccarat so far? Not much is known, but they are said to be connected to both the Comte St. Germain and Captain Jack Randall. In episode 2, we see the Baccarat meet with Randall and offer him a deal - information in exchange for leniency.

We also know that they have some sort of connection to France, as they are able to travel there easily and know people in high places. There are also rumours that they may have something to do with the Jacobite rebellion.

One thing is for sure - the Baccarat is definitely up to no good! We can only wait and see what further secrets they will reveal in upcoming episodes.
