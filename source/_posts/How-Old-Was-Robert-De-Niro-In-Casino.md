#  How Old Was Robert De Niro In Casino?

Robert De Niro was in his early forties when he starred in the 1995 classic Casino.

The role earned him critical praise and put him back on the map as one of the greats of modern acting. But what else do we know about the film and De Niro's involvement?

For starters, the movie is based on a true story - specifically, the tale of Las Vegas mobster Frank Rosenthal. However, De Niro insisted that his character, Sam Ace Rothstein, be portrayed as a composite of several people rather than a single individual.

He also did a lot of research to get into the headspace of Rothstein, studying tapes of Rosenthal and reading up on Mafia history. In fact, his preparation was so extensive that Martin Scorsese - who directed Casino - said it was "amazing how much he knew about it".

De Niro's commitment to his art paid off; Casino is now considered one of the best crime dramas ever made. And with his commanding performance at its centre, it's easy to see why.

#  Casino: Robert De Niro's Age

Casino is a 1995 American epic crime film directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone. It is based on the non-fiction book Casino: Love and Honor in Las Vegas by Nicholas Pileggi.

The film portrays the fictional Stoddard Sands casino and the events that take place there over the course of five days. Bobby Sunday (De Niro), a small-time bookie, takes over the casino after mobsters Sam "Ace" Rothstein (Pesci) and Nicky Santoro (Pitt) are banned from it for life.

The role of Sam "Ace" Rothstein was originally offered to Warren Beatty, who turned it down due to the production delay resulting from Flintstones production delays.

The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for De Niro, winning none. 

Robert De Niro was paid $1 million for his role in Casino.

#  Robert de Niro's Role in Casino

Robert de Niro is a world-renowned actor who has starred in over 100 films in his career. One of his most notable roles is as Sam "Ace" Rothstein in the 1995 Martin Scorsese film Casino.

De Niro was cast in the role after Scorsese saw him in the 1990 film Goodfellas, which also starred De Niro and was directed by Scorsese. In Casino, De Niro plays a gangster who is sent to Las Vegas to oversee the operations of a casino owned by the mob.

The role was a perfect fit for De Niro, who had previous experience playing gangsters in films such as Mean Streets and Raging Bull. De Niro's performance in Casino was praised by critics and he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor.

The success of Casino led to a follow-up film, titled Casino Royale, which was released in 2006 and starred Daniel Craig as James Bond. Casino Royale marked De Niro's first appearance in a James Bond movie and he played the role of villainous financier Le Chiffre.

In addition to his work as an actor, De Niro has also been involved in several restaurant businesses. In 1998, he co-founded the Nobu restaurant chain with actor friend Robert Redford and chef Nobuyuki Matsuhisa.

#  Did You Know? Robert De Niro was 47 years old when he played in Casino 

Casino may have been released in 1995, but it was actually shot in 1991 and 1992. However, the reason it took so long to get to the big screen was because of a rights dispute between the production company and Martin Scorsese. 

The actor who played Sam “Ace” Rothstein, Robert De Niro, was 47 years old when the movie was shot. This made him one of the oldest actors to portray a leading character in a casino-themed movie. In fact, the next oldest actor to do so was Gene Hackman, who was only 45 when he starred in 1998’s The Gambler. 

Interestingly enough, both De Niro and Hackman had previously starred in Francis Ford Coppola’s The Godfather: Part II. De Niro played Vito Corleone as a young man, while Hackman played Hermann Roth, a rival casino boss.

#  Robert De Niro's Age In Casino: How Did He Look?

In the 1995 classic "Casino," Robert De Niro plays the role of Sam Ace Rothstein, a character based on real-life gangster Frank Rosenthal. At the time of filming, De Niro was 52 years old. How did he look for his age?

De Niro's hair was thinning on top, and he had some wrinkles around his eyes, but overall he looked pretty good for his age. His face had more lines than it does now, but that only served to give him more character.

Overall, De Niro's appearance in "Casino" was quite convincing. He managed to convincingly play a man who was in his 50s, and he didn't look too out of place next to fellow actors like Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci.
