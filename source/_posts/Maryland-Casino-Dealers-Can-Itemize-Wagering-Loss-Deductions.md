#  Maryland Casino Dealers Can Itemize Wagering Loss Deductions

The Maryland casino dealers’ union has won the right to itemize wagering losses deductions on their state income tax returns. This is a big win for the more than 1,000 dealers working in Maryland’s six casinos, who will be able to deduct their losses up to $10,000 from their taxable income.

This new ruling overturns a previous decision by the state comptroller that prevented casino dealers from deducting their gambling losses. The comptroller had argued that because dealers are considered “agents of the casino,” they could not claim losses as deductions. But the union successfully argued that the dealers are employees and not agents, and are therefore entitled to the same tax deductions as any other employee.

This is good news for the dealers, who often incur large losses while playing blackjack and other casino games. Deducting those losses can help offset their taxable income and reduce their overall tax burden.

The ruling is also good news for the casinos, which stand to benefit from increased employee productivity. With the threat of larger tax bills looming over them, dealers will be less likely to gamble away their earnings. This should lead to more focus on customer service and ultimately better results for the casinos.

#  How to Itemize Wagering Losses on Your Maryland Casino Tax Return

When you go to an Maryland casino, you may be able to deduct your losses on your state tax return. In order to do this, you must itemize your deductions. You can only claim your losses up to the amount of your winnings. Here is how to report your casino losses on your Maryland tax return:

1) Determine the total amount of your wagering losses for the year. This includes all of the money that you lost while gambling at a casino in Maryland.

2) Add this amount to any other gambling losses that you had during the year. This could include money that you lost while playing poker, betting on horses, or playing slot machines at a racetrack.

3) Subtract the total of your gambling winnings from step 1 from the total of your gambling losses from steps 1 and 2. This will give you your net loss from gambling for the year.

4) Report this amount on line 26 of Form 502, the Maryland individual income tax return. Note that this loss is not deductible from your federal taxable income.

#  Maryland Casino Dealers Can Deduct Gambling Losses

In November 2018, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released a memorandum stating that Maryland casino dealers can deduct their gambling losses from their taxable income. The memorandum is in response to a question from a casino dealer in Maryland about whether or not they are able to claim these losses.

The IRS memo begins by stating that federal law does not prohibit dealers from deducting their gambling losses on their tax return. The memo goes on to say that, because of this, the dealer can claim their losses as an itemized deduction on Schedule A of Form 1040. As long as the dealer keeps good records of their gambling activity, they will be able to support any deductions they make on their tax return.

This news is sure to be welcome by Maryland casino dealers, who can now offset any losses they may have had while gambling against their taxable income. This new ruling also provides clarity for other casino workers in the state who may have been uncertain about whether or not they could claim gambling losses.

#  How to Claim a Gambling Loss deduction in Maryland

In order to claim a gambling loss deduction in Maryland, taxpayers must meet certain requirements. The first requirement is that the taxpayer must itemize deductions on their tax return. Gambling losses cannot be claimed as a standard deduction. Secondly, the losses must be ordinary and necessary expenses incurred in carrying out the taxpayer's trade or business. Gambling losses are considered ordinary expenses if they are common and accepted in the taxpayer's trade or business. Lastly, the amount of losses that can be deducted cannot exceed the amount of winnings reported on the return.

The gambling loss deduction can be helpful to taxpayers who have incurred significant losses from gambling activities. In order to take advantage of this deduction, it is important to keep track of all of your gambling-related expenses throughout the year. This includes costs such as tickets, food, beverages, and hotel rooms. If you are able to itemize your deductions, you can claim these costs as gambling losses on your tax return.

It is also important to note that only gambling activities with an expected net loss can be used to offset income. Gambling activities with an expected net gain cannot be used to reduce income taxation. For example, if you play blackjack at a casino and have an expected net loss of $100, you can use this amount to offset other income on your tax return. However, if you play blackjack at a casino and have an expected net gain of $100, you cannot use this amount to offset other income on your tax return.

#  When You Can and Cannot Itemize Gambling Losses

The IRS allows taxpayers to deduct losses from their gambling activities, but there are limits on how much you can claim. Here is a guide to when you can and cannot itemize gambling losses on your tax return.

To be able to itemize your gambling losses, you must meet two requirements:
1)You must have incurred the losses in a taxable year for which you are filing a federal income tax return.
2)Your losses must exceed your winnings for the year. In other words, your net loss from gambling must be more than zero.

If you meet these two requirements, you can deduct your losses up to the amount of your winnings. So if you had $1,000 in winnings and $1,500 in losses, you would only be able to deduct $1,000 of the losses. Any excess deduction would be carried forward and used in future years if you have additional winnings and net losses from gambling activities.

There are several things that you cannot include as gambling losses: 
1) Losses from wagering on horse races or dog races. 
2) Losses from playing poker tournaments. 
3) Losses from playing casino games such as blackjack, craps, roulette, or baccarat. 
4) Losses from using a bookie or any other kind of agent or middleman. 
5) Losses resulting from betting on sports teams or contests.
6) Casualty and theft losses that are not associated with gambling activities (e.g., car accident while traveling to/from a casino). 
7) The cost of travel expenses related to gambling activities (e.g., hotel room, airfare, meals). 
8) Lawyers' fees and other costs related to suing or defending against allegations of illegal gambling activities.
