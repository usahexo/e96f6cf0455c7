#  What is Lucky Joker 20?

Lucky Joker 20 is a digital version of the traditional casino game, Lucky Joker. The objective of the game is to draw as many cards as possible until you either hit the joker or bust. The player with the highest card value at the end of the game wins.

# Playing Lucky Joker 20

To play Lucky Joker 20, first select your stake by clicking on one of the betting chips at the bottom of the screen. You can choose from 0.10, 0.50, 1.00, 5.00 or 10.00. Once you have placed your bet, click on Deal to start drawing cards.

The cards are displayed in three rows of five and you must select two cards from each row to make your hand. If you hit the joker, your winnings will be doubled and if you bust (draw more than ten cards), you lose your bet. The goal is to beat the dealer's hand value without going over 21.

If both players have the same card value, the round is a push and neither player wins or loses money. At the end of each round, your total winnings or losses are displayed in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen.
