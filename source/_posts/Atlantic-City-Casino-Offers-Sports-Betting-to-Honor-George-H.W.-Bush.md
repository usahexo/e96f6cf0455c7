#  Atlantic City Casino Offers Sports Betting to Honor George H.W. Bush

Casino officials in Atlantic City announced on Wednesday that they would be opening a sports betting operation in honor of the late George H.W. Bush, who was a regular visitor to the city during his life.

“We are proud to offer this tribute to President Bush, who was a great friend of Atlantic City and its casinos,” said Joe Kelly, president of Hard Rock Casino Atlantic City.

The sports betting area will be located near the property’s main entrance and will have several television screens broadcasting sporting events. Bush was an avid sports fan and is said to have visited casinos in Atlantic City to watch horse races and other sporting events.

In addition to the sports betting area, the casino will also be displaying a photo exhibit of Bush throughout his life, as well as hosting a special charity event in his memory later this month.

#  Atlantic City Casinos Offer Sports Betting in Honor of George W. Bush

Atlantic City casinos are honoring George W. Bush this week by allowing sports betting in his honor.

The former president will be in Atlantic City on Thursday to commemorate the opening of the Ocean Resort Casino. In honor of the former president, casinos will allow sports betting all day on Thursday.

Bush is a known fan of sports, and is especially fond of baseball. He has even been known to place wagers on games.

"It's great that Atlantic City is honoring George W. Bush," said one fan of the former president. "He was a great leader, and I'm sure he'll enjoy watching some baseball while he's here."

Casinos in Atlantic City are expecting big crowds for Thursday's events, and are preparing for large amounts of sports betting action.

#  Atlantic City Betting on Sports to Honor George H.W. and George W. Bush

The Atlantic City Sports betting scene is honoring the Bush family with a new promotion in their honor. The first ever Bush-themed sports betting area has been set up at the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa.

In this new section, there are six different stations where bettors can place their wagers. Each of these stations is named after a specific event that happened during the 41st and 43rd presidents administrations. Some of these events include the Gulf War, Operation Iraqi Freedom and the September 11th terrorist attacks.

Each station has a number of different betting options for those looking to commemorate these historic moments. There are bets for who will win the upcoming Super Bowl, as well as prop bets for all of the individual games leading up to it.

In addition to football, there are also odds for other sporting events such as the NBA and college basketball. Bettors can also place wagers on current political topics, including whether or not President Donald Trump will be impeached before the end of his first term.

While some may see this as simply a way to make money, there is no doubt that this new Bush-themed area pays tribute to two very important American presidents.

#  Atlantic City Honors 41st and 43rd Presidents with Sports Betting

In an unexpected but welcomed move, Atlantic City has announced that it will be starting sports betting in honor of Presidents 41st and 43rd. There was some initial confusion as to why two different presidents were being honored, but a spokesperson for the city clarified that “Atlantic City is a place where everyone is welcome, and we want to celebrate the history and diversity of our great city.”

Despite the backlash on social media, many residents of Atlantic City are thrilled with the decision. One local man said that “it’s about time that we recognized these two great presidents. They both did amazing things for our country, and I can’t wait to place my bets on the Super Bowl.”

Others have expressed concerns that the move could lead to increased crime and gambling addiction in the city, but officials remain confident that sports betting will be a positive addition to Atlantic City. They believe that it will not only bring in much-needed revenue, but also help to create jobs and attract new tourists to the area.

#  New Jersey Sports Betting Reaches Out to Honor George H.W. and George W. Bush

In the weeks since the death of George H.W. Bush, there’s been a concerted effort to memorialize him in a variety of ways. From naming buildings after him to cancelling partisan politics in Washington for a day, it seems that almost everyone has contributed in some way or another.

One such tribute is coming from the world of sports betting, where New Jersey has announced that it will be dedicating its first legal sports betting lounge to the 41st president. The lounge, which is set to open on December 12th at Monmouth Park Racetrack, will be named “The George H.W. Bush Sports Lounge” and will offer fans a variety of gambling options as well as food and drink specials.

Bush was a longtime friend of Monmouth Park Racetrack – he attended the track’s opening back in 1970 – so it was only natural for the facility to want to do something in his memory. In addition to the lounge, there will also be a special “Bush 41” race taking place on December 8th, with all proceeds from ticket sales going towards the former president’s eventual presidential library.

Interestingly enough, this won’t be the only sports betting tribute to George H.W. Bush; just last week, Delaware also announced that it would be renaming its racetrack after him. The new “Bushwood Downs” racetrack is set to open in early 2019 and will offer live and online betting options as well as food and beverage services.

Both of these tributes are a testament to Bush’s lasting legacy, and they should provide plenty of excitement for sports bettors in both states. With the football season coming to a close and basketball getting ready to start up, there’s never been a better time to place some wagers on your favorite teams!
